# 👋 About Me

I am a systems-oriented student currently exploring the cybersecurity field, with a growing interest in offensive security and penetration testing.

My curiosity about cybersecurity began from being genuinely astonished by cyberwarfare — the invisible digital battlefield where technical sophistication, geopolitical strategy, and system vulnerabilities intersect. Understanding how complex attacks are designed and executed motivated me to start building my own technical foundation.

## 🎓 Academic Background

I am currently studying the pre-degree program:

**Tecnicatura Universitaria en Administración de Sistemas y Software Libre**

This program provided me with my foundational knowledge in:

- Networking fundamentals
- Linux systems
- System administration principles
- Software architecture basics

Alongside my formal studies, I am completing the **Cisco Cybersecurity Essentials** course to strengthen my theoretical understanding of cyber threats, defense strategies, and security principles.

## 🛠 Technical Skills

I am comfortable working with:

- Linux terminal (file management, diagnostics, system navigation)
- Virtual machine environments
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, basic subnetting)
- Python
- PHP

I have also:

- Hardened a Linux system (basic SSH configuration and service management)
- Used tools like `nmap` for network scanning (at a beginner level)

While I do not yet consider myself an expert, I am consistently improving my understanding of security tools, system internals, and attack methodologies.

## 🔍 Current Focus

I am currently:

- Expanding my cybersecurity knowledge through structured learning
- Strengthening my Linux and networking foundations
- Exploring penetration testing concepts
- Improving my technical English vocabulary for better documentation and communication

## 🎯 Professional Direction

Although I am still exploring different areas within cybersecurity, I am particularly drawn to penetration testing and offensive security. I am interested in understanding how vulnerabilities are discovered, exploited, and ultimately mitigated.

My goal is to evolve from a systems-oriented student into a security professional capable of thinking both defensively and offensively.

## 📈 Mindset

I believe in:

- Continuous learning
- Hands-on experimentation
- Building real understanding instead of memorizing concepts
- Staying humble while developing technical depth

This repository documents my progress, projects, and learning journey as I grow in the cybersecurity field.
